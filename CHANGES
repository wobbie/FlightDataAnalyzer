 - Groundspeed established from Longitudinal Acceleration within Groundspeed 
   During RTO Max
 - TAWS Alert can_operate method fix
 - Invalidate "Year" parameter before calculate timebase so we use the 
   fallback_dt.year in its place.
 - create_kpvs_within_slices fix to rounding of start and stop edges
 - Improved smoothing of Heading and Altitude for Hercules aircraft
 - bearings_and_distances library routine improved for earth curvature
 - Multiple Go Around KPV improvements
 
Nodes added:
 - "Master Caution" merges multiple signals
 - "Pitch Above 1000 Ft Min" and "Pitch Above 1000 Ft Max"

Nodes removed:
 - Removed "Altitude STD At Lifoff" and "Altitude STD At Touchdown" KPVs
 - Removed "Configuration At Landing" KPV as we rely upon "Flap At Touchdown"
 
 
v0.4.1
------
 - A319, A320, A321 support - Flap Lever (Synthetic), Configuration and Speedbrake
 
Improvements:
 - climb flight phase added to Height Loss KPVs
 - AOA works from just one signal rather than relying on both (A) and (B)
 - Nodes support setting of aliases "hz" and "sample_rate" in place of frequency
 - Overflow correction fix 0.0 now does nothing rather than mask
 - TCAS RA uses recorded TCAS RA parameter (on Airbus) in preference to 
   TCAS Combined Control (on Boeings)
 - Altitude correction for CRJ Alitiude Radio
 - Improve overflow correction for Altitude Radio
 - Split Segments supports GROUND_ONLY when no movement determined on ground
   based upon Heading.
 - FlapAtTouchdown KPVs all use the Flap Angle rather than the Flap Lever
 - process_flight supports stripping of hdf5 derived parameters for reprocessing
 - _value library now returns states (assumes order by that of raw value)
 - Master Warning inhibited when engines not running
 - ILS Established works better with low sample rate data and makes sure the 
   aircraft path converges onto the beam and does not just pass through.
 - Flight Phase "Bottom Of Descent" revised to be more robust
 - Gross Weight at Liftoff and touchdown - catch repair errors where no valid data


v0.3.2
------

 - Fix to thrust_reversers_working indexing (including refactor of 
   clump_multistate)


v0.3.1
------
 - Flap Angle supports more than two signals, including (C) and (MCP) channels
 - Improvements to Top Of Climb (find_toc_tod) and Bottom of Descent (uses just 
   ClimbCruiseDescent) make climbs and descents more robust.
 - ILS Frequency only reports valid frequency if both (1) and (2) channels are 
   recording same frequency.
 - Airspeed with Flap 0 and Slat something.
 - Support for Slat included in Flap Lever (Synthetic) to ensure slat only 
   transitions are included.


v0.2.2
------
 - Fix to nodes to calculate a new offset when aligning to a higher frequency
   to ensure offset does not exceed the time of the first sample


v0.2.1
------
 - Added analyzer profiles
 - Support for CL-600 Aircraft Families
 - Support for A340 Aircraft Families
 - Support for BD-100 Aircraft Families
 - Speedbrake refactoring
 - Added Airbus KPV's
 - Support for ground runs
 - Support for slat stepping
 - Clip replaced with second_window
  - Improves speed
  - Corrects truncation of adjacent peaks

  
v0.1.1
------

 - Numerous improvements


v0.0.6
-----

 - Support for Beechcraft 1900D.
 - Improved liftoff detection algorithm.


v0.0.2
-----

 - Support for B757 / B767.


v0.0.1
------

 - Initial release directed at B737.
